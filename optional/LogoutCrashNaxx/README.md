# Optional files
* `LogoutCrashNaxx` if a player logout in Naxx Vanilla and try to relog, client crash occured

## LogoutCrashNaxx
This folder contains:
* `Modules/mod-naxxramas-logout-teleport`
* `ElunaScripts/NaxxKick.lua`

Use the module OR the Eluna script. Choose one, not both.
This mod acts as a temporary solution. If the player is in naxx on log in, it'll teleport them right outside the raid. Player may have to attempt logging in twice.
